# Define the total spending
spending = 50 + 44 + 31 + 18 + 2 + 1

# Define the spending limit
limit = 500

# Check if the total spending is less than or equal to the spending limit
result = spending <= limit

# Print the result
print(result)

#In this code, we define the total spending and the spending limit. Then, we check if the total spending is less than or equal to the spending limit using the less than or equal to operator (`<=`). Finally, we print the result..</s>
