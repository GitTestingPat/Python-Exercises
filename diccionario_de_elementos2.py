# Define a dictionary to store the classification of characters
classification = {"villanos":{1:"Thanos", 2:"Moriarty", 3:"Voldemort"},
                 "protagonistas":["Iron Man", "Sherlock", "Harry Potter"],
                 "indefinido":("Gollum", "Severus Snape")}

# The dictionary is structured as follows:
# - The keys are the categories of characters: "villanos", "protagonistas", and "indefinido".
# - The values are dictionaries or lists that store the characters within each category.
#   - For the "villanos" category, the values are a dictionary with keys representing the rank of the villain and values representing the villain's name.
#   - For the "protagonistas" category, the values are a list of the protagonist's names.
#   - For the "indefinido" category, the values are a tuple of the characters that do not fit into the other categories.
