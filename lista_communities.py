#In this code, we define the heights of the streets in three different cities. We then create a list of lists, where each list contains the heights of the streets in a city.
#
#We iterate through each city in the list of cities using a for loop. For each city, we iterate through each street in the city using another for loop.
#
#Finally, we print the name of each street using the print function..</s>
