# Define the cost of a biscuit
biscuit = 2.50

# Define the number of candies
candies = '10'

# Convert the number of candies from a string to an integer
candies_as_int = int(candies)

# Calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the biscuit and the cost of the candies
total_cost = biscuit + candies_as_int

# Print the total cost
print(total_cost)
#
#In this code, we define the cost of a biscuit and the number of candies. We then convert the number of candies from a string to an integer, as the `int()` function is used to convert a string to an integer.
