#This code defines a list of team members, including some empty strings. It then iterates through each member in the team list. If a member's name is an empty string, the code skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it prints the member's name. If the member's name is 'Avery Gonzalez', the code prints a special message and breaks out of the loop..</s>
