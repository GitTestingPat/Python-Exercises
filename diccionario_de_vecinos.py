# Define a dictionary called 'neighbors' to store the neighbors' ages and names
neighbors = {
    11: ("Leo", "Xavier", "Max"),
    21: ("Layla", "Isla", "Chloe", "Ava"),
    26: ("Gabriella", "Luna"),
    9: ("Amelia", "Cooper", "Sadie")

# Print the names of the neighbors who are 26 years old
print(neighbors[26])

#
#In this code, we define a dictionary called 'neighbors' to store the neighbors' ages and names. Each key-value pair represents an age and a tuple of names.
#
#Then, we print the names of the neighbors who are 26 years old by accessing the value associated with the key 26.
#
#This code is simple, efficient, and easy to understand..</s>
